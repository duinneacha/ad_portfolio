  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am Aidan Dennehy, a web developer and data scientist with a passion for creating innovative solutions. My journey in technology began with a City & Guilds Applications programming course in 1988/89 in Dublin, followed by a FAS graduate course in Software Engineering in Cork.</p>

  <p>After working abroad for many years, I returned to education in 2013, completing a Focus programme and a FETAC Level 6 in Networks and Web Design at St. John's College in Cork. This rekindled my passion for learning, leading me to earn a BSc in Web Development and an MSc in Data Science & Analytics from Munster Technological University.</p>

  <p>Professionally, I have diverse experience, including working as a Data Analyst at B&Q, where I developed bespoke audit tools, and participating in a British Overseas Development Authority project in India to implement Plant Maintenance and Production Reporting systems.</p>

  <p>I am proficient in Python, R, and JavaScript, and have experience with web development frameworks like Vue, Laravel, and Jamstack. In data science, I utilise libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and OpenCV, along with visualization tools like Shiny, ggplot2, and D3.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in collaborating, whether it be for freelance work, full-time opportunities, or partnerships, feel free to get in touch via the <a href="{{ '/contact' | relative_url }}">Contact Me</a> page.</p>
