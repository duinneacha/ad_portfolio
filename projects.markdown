    <h3>Enhancing Accuracy in Optical Character Recognition of Sensor Readings: A Comparative Study of Tesseract and CRNN Models with Emphasis on Image Pre-processing</h3>

    <p>A key innovative aspect of this MSc thesis was the introduction of novel image pre-processing techniques that significantly boosted the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) on sensor reading images.</p>
    <p>The research focused on comparing the performance of Tesseract OCR and convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models. A standout finding was that Tesseract OCR outperformed the CRNN model, achieving up to 100% accuracy in some image folders after applying specialized pre-processing.</p>
    <p>The thesis introduced a novel approach involving color masking that proved highly effective. For seven-segment displays, applying a red mask enhanced digit clarity, while a green mask minimized noise for dot-matrix displays. Merging these tailored color masks with Tesseract OCR was a technique not often seen in existing literature, yet it offered substantial improvements in accuracy.</p>
    <p>Other key pre-processing steps included techniques like thresholding, morphological operations, denoising, and deblurring. The research underscored the critical importance of optimizing image quality and contrast to enhance OCR performance.</p>
    <p>By systematically tailoring the pre-processing approach to the unique characteristics of each image folder, the study was able to achieve significant accuracy gains, in some cases increasing from an initial 1% to over 47%. This demonstrates the power of innovative image pre-processing in driving OCR improvements.</p>
    <p>The findings from this MSc thesis have clear real-world implications for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of industrial sensor monitoring systems through advanced OCR techniques.</p>
