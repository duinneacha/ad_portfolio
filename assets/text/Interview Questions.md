Interview Questions
Background and Education
Can you tell me about your educational background?
Well I did a City & Guilds Applications programming course in 1988/89 in Dublin. Straight after this, I then did a six month FAS graduate course in Software Engineering in Cork. After working many years abroad, I returned to education in 2013 to complete a year long Focus programme run by the National Learning Network. From this, I regained the education bug and completed a FETAC eevel 6 Networks and Web Design at St. John's College in Cork. Boosted by exceptional results here, I went on to complete a BSC in Computer Science and an MSc in Data Science & Analytics.

As a mature student the services on offer to guide me to my goals were absolutely marvellous.

What degrees do you hold, and from which institutions?
BSc Web Development Munster Technologial University
MSc Data Science & Analytics Munster Technologial University

Were there any specific courses or projects during your education that significantly contributed to your skills in web development and data science?

There were many, I particularly liked the Data Visualisation modules which scientifically break down the best ways to represent data. I have a good strong programming background so any modules with a programming theme were great to learn.

Professional Experience
Can you highlight some key projects or roles from your professional experience?

I worked as a Data Analyst with an audit team at the B&Q head offices in Eastleigh, Hampshire. I focused on identifying and capturing the relevant data from the client to ensure the audit's scope, and developing a bespoke set of audit tools tailored to the client's systems and processes. This client-focused approach led to a consistent year-over-year increase in recoveries. I spearheaded the development of a system that granted the client comprehensive access to all captured data, further integrating our services into their operations.

I spent four years working as part of a team to develop and implement Plant Maintenance and Production Reporting systems into a coal mine in Amlohri, India as part of a British Overseas Development Authority project. It was lovely reading years afterwards how much of a positive impact it had with the growth of the coal mine.

What were your primary responsibilities in these roles?

Programmer
Analyst
Network Manager
Consultant

What technologies did you work with?

Over the years, I have worked with many programming languages, primarily focusing on PC-based systems. For the past 7 years, I have had fantastic deep exposure web development, from the basic building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to utilizing libraries and frameworks such as Vue, Laravel, Jamstack, and many more.

In the data science field, my work has primarily been Python and R-based, utilising libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and OpenCV to create models for prediction and classification.

Many visual technologies such as Shiny, ggplot2, MatPlotlib, D3 and many more.

Can you share any notable achievements or successes in your career?

Earning my MSc in Data Science & Analytics has been a significant milestone in my career. This accomplishment provided me with advanced skills in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, enabling me to solve complex problems and contribute to data-driven decision-making effectively.

Within the audit team at B&Q, I cultivated the relationships required to open data channels to help maximise the possible recoveries.
